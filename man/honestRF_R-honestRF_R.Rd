\title{honestRF_R Constructor}
\format{An object of class \code{NULL} of length 0.}
\usage{
honestRF_R(x, y, ntree = 500, replace = TRUE, sampsize = if (replace)
  nrow(x) else ceiling(0.632 * nrow(x)), mtry = max(floor(ncol(x)/3), 1),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of all training predictors.}

\item{y}{A vector of all training responses.}

\item{ntree}{The number of trees to grow in the forest. The default value is
500.}

\item{replace}{An indicator of whether sampling of training data is with
replacement. The default value is TRUE.}

\item{sampsize}{The size of total samples to draw for the training data. If
sampling with replacement, the default value is the length of the training
data. If samplying without replacement, the default value is two-third of
the length of the training data.}

\item{mtry}{The number of variables randomly selected at each split point.
The default value is set to be one third of total number of features of the
training data.}

\item{nodesizeSpl}{The minimum observations contained in terminal nodes. The
default value is 5.}

\item{nthread}{The number of threads to use in parallel computing. The
default value is 1.}

\item{splitrule}{A string to specify how to find the best split among all
candidate feature values. The current version only supports `variance` which
minimizes the overall MSE after splitting. The default value is `variance`.}

\item{avgfunc}{An averaging function to average observations in the node. The
function is used for prediction. The input of this function should be a
dataframe of predictors `x` and a vector of outcomes `y`. The output is a
scalar. The default function is to take the mean of vector `y`.}

\item{splitratio}{Proportion of the training data used as the splitting
dataset. It is a ratio between 0 and 1. If the ratio is 1, then essentially
splitting dataset becomes the total entire sampled set and the averaging
dataset is empty. If the ratio is 0, then the splitting data set is empty
and all the data is used for the averaging data set (This is not a good
usage however since there will be no data available for splitting).}

\item{nodesizeAvg}{Minimum size of terminal nodes for averaging dataset.
The default value is 5.}
