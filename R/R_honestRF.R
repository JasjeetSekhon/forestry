#' @name honestRF_R-class
#' @rdname honestRF_R-class
#' @description `honestRF_R` inherits `RF`, which serves as a modified version of
#' `RF`. The major change is that it trains honest trees instead of adaptive
#' trees. Adaptive trees are the original trees as they were used in the
#' original implementation and honest trees differ in that they require two
#' data sets to do tree estimation. One data set is used to create the trees
#' and the other one is used to receive the leaf estimates.
#' @slot splitratio Proportion of the training data used as the splitting
#' dataset. It is a ratio between 0 and 1. If the ratio is 1, then essentially
#' splitting dataset becomes the total entire sampled set and the averaging
#' dataset is empty. If the ratio is 0, then the splitting data set is empty
#' and all the data is used for the averaging data set (This is not a good
#' usage however since there will be no data available for splitting).

#' @description Initialize a `honestRF_R` object.
#' @param x A data frame of all training predictors.
#' @param y A vector of all training responses.
#' @param ntree The number of trees to grow in the forest. The default value is
#' 500.
#' @param replace An indicator of whether sampling of training data is with
#' replacement. The default value is TRUE.
#' @param sampsize The size of total samples to draw for the training data. If
#' sampling with replacement, the default value is the length of the training
#' data. If samplying without replacement, the default value is two-third of
#' the length of the training data.
#' @param mtry The number of variables randomly selected at each split point.
#' The default value is set to be one third of total number of features of the
#' training data.
#' @param nodesizeSpl The minimum observations contained in terminal nodes. The
#' default value is 5.
#' @param nthread The number of threads to use in parallel computing. The
#' default value is 1.
#' @param splitrule A string to specify how to find the best split among all
#' candidate feature values. The current version only supports `variance` which
#' minimizes the overall MSE after splitting. The default value is `variance`.
#' @param avgfunc An averaging function to average observations in the node. The
#' function is used for prediction. The input of this function should be a
#' dataframe of predictors `x` and a vector of outcomes `y`. The output is a
#' scalar. The default function is to take the mean of vector `y`.
#' @param splitratio Proportion of the training data used as the splitting
#' dataset. It is a ratio between 0 and 1. If the ratio is 1, then essentially
#' splitting dataset becomes the total entire sampled set and the averaging
#' dataset is empty. If the ratio is 0, then the splitting data set is empty
#' and all the data is used for the averaging data set (This is not a good
#' usage however since there will be no data available for splitting).
#' @param nodesizeAvg Minimum size of terminal nodes for averaging dataset.
#' The default value is 5.
